current:
Move code tag from bottom -> figure out how to make it work, e.g. where to put it

make the base layout visually appealing

fix work card, maybe re-work it, or make it an explicit github link, including icon

min portfolio photo, keep it in active memory with preloader

-> (this might be critical due to the awkwardness of resizing) Fade in every card even when we go BACK to the original card FROM code using fadeIn mixin

maybe:
reconsider use of enum
grid-based card
dont use crement button images

mostly done:
keep refactoring "page" component, passing down through portfolio
show basic file dependencies too for visual code elements
don't let github image overflow container

pie in the sky:
add code editor to code page
