CURRENT FOCUS:

make the base layout visually appealing, refactor it, too (one idea is to pass down props to style initial card in higher scope)

write some valid blog posts

fix work card, maybe re-work it, or make it an explicit github link, including icon

refac contents into larger component


grid-based card

min portfolio photo, keep it in active memory with preloader

Move code tag from bottom -> figure out how to make it work, e.g. where to put it

Fade in every card even when we go BACK to the original card FROM code using fadeIn mixin

extract other components, like "nav"

show basic file dependencies too for visual code elements

write interfaces for props

Pie in the sky:
add code editor to code page
