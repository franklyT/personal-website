# THE WHY

My goal with these posts is rather simple, and generally seeks to respect what I understand as the principles of user-experience (UX): the time of a would-be user of my website is limited, and it is incumbent upon me to respect it.

As such, I will herein offer bite-sized ruminations on my primary topics of interest: education and computer science, and often how these fields can work hand-in-glove.

The vow being made is the vow of any front-end developer: concision above all, and simplicity above much (except wherein it is impossible to maintain).

Thank for you taking the time to read my thoughts.
