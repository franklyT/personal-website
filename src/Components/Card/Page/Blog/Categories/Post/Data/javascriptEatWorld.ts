# JAVASCRIPT EAT WORLD
JavaScript, as I understand it, spent the better part of two decades being kind of ridiculous.

Of course, in spite of itself, it remained the browser lingua franca, and thusly sat at the forefront of the web revolution, for better or worse.

In concert with the rise of the web has come the rise of the web browser. The robust APIs that modern browsers expose, and rapid JIT compilation of JavaScript code,
work in powerful concert to produce some of the most useful (and used) technologies of our time: Electron (via VSCode), Node, even Chrome OS.

Even so, with WebAssembly on the horizon, some have begun to eulogize JavaScript, rejoicing that the end of an era is nigh.

Ever so silently, however, JavaScript has begun to consume and transform. 

Gone are the days of awkward direct prototype manipulation, as JavaScript has moved towards supporting a fairly robust
OOP methodology, with the help of syntactical supersets like TypeScript. Gone even, are the days of robust in-house hand-rolling of solutions, and nigh are the days where JavaScript programmers
exist as the logical glue for a variety of SaaS services (many of which, of course, might even themselves use WebAssembly).

If one were in the business of predictions, the safer approach, it would seem, would be the ascendancy of JavaScript, as have the many years (somehow) portended.

Jamstack - the switch from house-rolled software solutions to the use of JavaScript as a robust systems glue in an SaaS environment. If I could predict what my kids would be doing as computer scientists, it would be this. It is an amazing opportunity
to be a part of this history, and I hope with some degree of good humor that one day people will look to engineers of our time as we do doctors of a bygone era: more butchers than surgeons, and a little more than rough around the edges, as explorers of
a very young art.
